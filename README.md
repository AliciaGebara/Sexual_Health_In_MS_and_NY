# Sexual Health in Mississippi and New York

---
## **Purpose**

***Why was this repository created?***

- This repository was created for Prof. Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring 2025 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

***What data does this repository provide?***

This repository contains...

- Raw data from [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://github.com/tarheel105/105-Unit-3/blob/main/data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) as a [`.csv file`](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) in the [Data folder](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/tree/main/Data) 

- A Mississippi and New York specific subset of the raw data: [`MSandNY.csv`](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Data/MSandNY.csv), also in the [Data folder](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/tree/main/Data). This data on aspects of sexual health, like teen births and rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), across Mississippi and New York in 2014-2015.

- The Python notebook, titled: [`Feeder3_1_Alicia_Gebara`](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Documentation/Feeder3_1_Alicia_Gebara.ipynb) in the [Documentation Folder](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/tree/main/Documentation), that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data.

## **Potential Uses and Applications** 

***Why is the dataset in this repository useful?***

- Examining certain aspects of sexual health across states like Mississippi and New York in 2014-2015 could reveal **discrepancies (or lack thereof) in sexual population health differences**. 


***What are the future research questions this data could lead to?*** 

- Using this data to identify potential discrepancies in sexual health could lead to **future research questions** about whether or not they were due to differences between Mississippi and New York **politically, geographically, or educationally**. 

- For example: 

> *Do states like New York, where sexual education is mandated, have fewer teen births and STIs than states like Mississippi, where sexual education is not mandated?*

- Comparing the correlations between teen births and STIs has the potential to reveal the **quality of those statesâ€™ sexual health programs and educational opportunities**.


***What are potential future applications of the methods shown in this repository?***

- Using these methods with **more current data** to compare Mississippi and New York may reveal an improvement or decline in either states' abilities to deal with sexual public health needs related to teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
- Using these methods with **states besides Mississippi and New York** could allow for smiliar examinations of wether or not political, geographic, or educational differences between states seem to be linked to differing qualities of sexual health.


***Who is this repository for?***
- Public health scientists, health policymakers, or other individuals wishing to learn more about the difference in sexual health data across states in the US.

## **Where to start** 

***How can users get started with the repository?***
1. The [Data Folder](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/tree/main/Data) folder to view both the raw data, [`CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv`](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) and the subset of the raw data, [`MSandNY.csv`](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Data/MSandNY.csv), to familiarize yourself with the original data and how it was manipulated. 
2. The [Documentation Folder](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/tree/main/Documentation) to view the Python notebook[`Feeder3_1_AliciaGebara`](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Documentation/Feeder3_1_Alicia_Gebara.ipynb), which details the step-by-step process of how the raw data was converted into the new Mississippi-New York specific subset. If you want to reacreate this process, this is where all the codes are. 
3. Return to [this landing page](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/tree/main) with a deepened understanding of the data when revisiting the graphs below in the "data visualization section".

## **Acknowlegements**

***Who maintains the repository?*** 
- This data repository was made and is maintained by Alicia Gebara. She is currently a B.S.P.H in Healthcare Policy and Management candidate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health.  
- The original, raw data came from [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://github.com/tarheel105/105-Unit-3/blob/main/data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv), which was shown to Alicia by her English professor, Dr. Gotzler.

### **Takeaways from the correlational dot-graph data visualization**
- In both Mississippi and New York's correlational dot graphs, it appears that teen birth has a relatively **strong, positive correlation to sexually transmitted infections (STIs)**. 
- **Mississippi**, *a state where sexual education is **not mandated in school*** has both, a **higher average number of teen births** per county and a **higher average of sexually transmitted infections** per county than **New York**, *a state where **sexual education is mandated in schools***. 
- While Mississippi's correlation between teen births and STIs seems visibly stronger than New York's, both states show that same positive association, potentially suggesting a **possible gap in sexual education or protective resources**. These findings could prompt future **sexual health research or health policy intervention**.
