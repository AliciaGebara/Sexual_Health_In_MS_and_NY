## Potential Uses and Applications 

*Why is the dataset in this repository useful?* 
Examining certain aspects of sexual health across states like Mississippi and New York in 2014-2015 could reveal discrepancies (or lack thereof) in sexual population health differences. These discrepancies could lead to future research questions about whether or not they were due to differences between Mississippi and New York politically, geographically, or educationally. 

For example: *Do states like New York, where sexual education is mandated, have fewer teen births and STIs than states like Mississippi, where sexual education is not mandated?*

Comparing the correlations between teen births and STIs has the potential to reveal the quality of those statesâ€™ sexual health programs and educational opportunities.

*What are potential future applications of the methods shown in this repository?*

- Using these methods with **more current data** to compare Mississippi and New York may reveal an improvement or decline in either states' abilities to deal with sexual public health needs related to teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
- Using these methods with **states besides Mississippi and New York** could allow for smiliar examinations of wether or not political, geographic, or educational differences between states seem to be linked to differing qualities of sexual health.
