# Sexual Health in Mississippi and New York

---
## **Purpose**

***Why was this repository created?***

- This repository was created for Prof. Gotzler's English 105 class in the Spring 2025 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

***What data does this repository provide?***

This repository contains...
- Raw data from [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://github.com/tarheel105/105-Unit-3/blob/main/data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv) as a `.csv` file in the "Data" folder 

- A Mississippi and New York specific subset of the raw data called `"MSandNY.csv"` also in the "Data" folder. This data on aspects of sexual health, like teen births and rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), across Mississippi and New York in 2014-2015.

- The Python notebook, titled: `"Feeder_3_1"` in the "Process Documentation" folder , that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data.

## **Potential Uses and Applications** 

***Why is the dataset in this repository useful?***

- Examining certain aspects of sexual health across states like Mississippi and New York in 2014-2015 could reveal **discrepancies (or lack thereof) in sexual population health differences**. 


***What are the future research questions this data could lead to?*** 

- Using this data to identify potential discrepancies in sexual health could lead to **future research questions** about whether or not they were due to differences between Mississippi and New York **politically, geographically, or educationally**. 

- For example: 

> *Do states like New York, where sexual education is mandated, have fewer teen births and STIs than states like Mississippi, where sexual education is not mandated?*

- Comparing the correlations between teen births and STIs has the potential to reveal the **quality of those statesâ€™ sexual health programs and educational opportunities**.


***What are potential future applications of the methods shown in this repository?***

- Using these methods with **more current data** to compare Mississippi and New York may reveal an improvement or decline in either states' abilities to deal with sexual public health needs related to teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
- Using these methods with **states besides Mississippi and New York** could allow for smiliar examinations of wether or not political, geographic, or educational differences between states seem to be linked to differing qualities of sexual health.


***Who is this repository for?***
- Public health scientists, health policymakers, or other individuals wishing to learn more about the difference in sexual health data across states in the US.

## **Where to start** 

***How can users get started with the repository?***
1. The Data folder to view both the raw data and the `MSandNY.csv` subset to familiarize yourself with the original data and how it was manipulated. 
2. The Documentation folder to view the Python notebook that details the step-by-step process of how the raw data was converted into the new Mississippi-New York specific subset. If you want to reacreate this process, this is where all the codes are. 
3. Return to this landing page with a deepened understanding of the data when revisiting the graphs below.

## **Acknowlegements**

***Who maintains the repository?*** 
- This data repository was made and is maintained by Alicia Gebara, a B.S.P.H Healthcare Policy and Management candidate at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill's Gillings School of Global Public Health.  
- The original, raw data came from [CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv](https://github.com/tarheel105/105-Unit-3/blob/main/data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv), which was shown to Alicia by her English professor, Dr. Gotzler.
