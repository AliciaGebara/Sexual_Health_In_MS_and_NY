# **Data**
## This folder contains:
1. A raw [dataset](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Data/CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv).
2. A [subset](https://github.com/AliciaGebara/Sexual_Health_In_MS_and_NY/blob/main/Data/MSandNY.csv) of that dataset.
3. Two correlational dot graphs, one for each state in the subset of the data: Mississippi and New York. These were made using Pandas and Markdown in a Google Colab notebook to visualize the correlation between teen births and sexually transmitted infections.
